x=[1,1,2,3,4] #understand data & data structure.  use sets and compare(decrease elements as there is duplicate)
s=[1,2,3,4]#use conditional to differentiate vaiables true/false
 #1.brut forcing- trying all of the combination (guessing one answeer will be there) (by dong in sequence)
 #2.use arrays - compare one elements with others by one by one 
 #3.time complex- [1,2,3] compare 6* as ^no.increase,time increases so n^2
 #

 a=[1,2,3,3,4] 
 b=[2,1,4,,2] 
 #solution 1. b can be sort by using brut force. (compare the elements of a)
           #2.by sorting b [1,2,2,4] 
           # time complexa= nlogn b=nlogn+n / o(nlogn)
           #space - O(n)
